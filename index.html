	<p>The Jedi High Council, simply known as the Jedi Council, was a body of<br>
	twelve Jedi Masters that governed the Jedi Order. Headquartered in the Jedi<br>
	Grand Temple on Coruscant, the High Council worked with the Galactic Senate<br>
	to maintain peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. In addition, the High<br>
	Council tracked the progress of the Jedi training of Padawans, deciding when<br>
	the time was right for an apprentice to undergo the Jedi Trials in order to<br>
	attain the rank of Jedi Knight, and from there, the rank of Master. The High<br>
	Council also enforced the Jedi Code and traditionally selected its own<br>
	members, including the Master of the Order who functioned as the body's<br>
	presiding officer.</p>

	<p>Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master who led the Jedi Order in the years leading<br>
	up to its destruction by the Sith and the transition of the Galactic Republic<br>
	into the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and<br>
	power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Jedi Order's<br>
	Grand Master. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the<br>
	Clone Wars, passing on the Jedi tradition to Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the<br>
	path to immortality.</p>

	<p>Mace Windu was a revered Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master and<br>
	member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Republic Era.<br>
	During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi<br>
	and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the<br>
	Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its<br>a
	ncient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in<br>
	the corrupt, declining days of the Republic.</p>

	served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic<br>
	conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of<br>
	Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous<br>
	missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion. Koon wore<br>
	a breath mask to filter the air around him so that it matched his home planet of<br>
	Dorin, and wore goggles to prevent his eye fluids from evaporating.</p>
