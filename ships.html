        text: X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled the High Galactic script's character "X" in attack formation. They were heavily armed with four laser cannons on the S-foils and proton torpedo launchers in the fuselage. X-wings were designed for dogfighting and long missions. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used X-wing models like the T-65B X-wing starfighter and T-65C-A2 X-wing in many battles, deploying X-wings in engagements such as the Attack on Lothal, the Battle of Yavin, the Battle of Endor, and the Battle of Jakku.

        text: The MC80 Star Cruisers, were capital ships used by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. These immense vessels were a startling contrast to the angular-shaped Imperial-class Star Destroyers, which were favored by the Imperial Fleet. Whereas the Imperial warship resembled a pointed dagger in shape, a Mon Calamari cruiser lacked hard angles and was covered with ovoid forms suggesting an organic sculpture. There were pods attached all around the ship, containing turbolasers, sensor arrays and viewing ports, the latter fulfilling the ships' original intended role as an exploration and observation vessel. Each cruiser was of a unique design. Despite their smooth lines, these vessels were heavily armed with dozens of turbolasers, SW-7 ion cannons, tractor beam projectors and shield generators.
