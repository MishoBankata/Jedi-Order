					<!--<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("hui").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'>Click Me!</button>-->
					
					<p id= "hui">X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled the High Galactic script's character "X" in attack formation. They were heavily armed with four laser cannons on the S-foils and proton torpedo launchers in the fuselage. X-wings were designed for dogfighting and long missions. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used X-wing models like the T-65B X-wing starfighter and T-65C-A2 X-wing in many battles, deploying X-wings in engagements such as the Attack on Lothal, the Battle of Yavin, the Battle of Endor, and the Battle of Jakku.</p>

					<p>The TIE/LN starfighter, or TIE/line starfighter, simply known as the TIE Fighter or T/F, was the standard Imperial starfighter seen in massive numbers throughout most of the Galactic Civil War and onward. Colloquially, Rebel and New Republic pilots referred to the craft as "eyeballs."</p>

					<p>The MC80 Star Cruisers, were capital ships used by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. These immense vessels were a startling contrast to the angular-shaped Imperial-class Star Destroyers, which were favored by the Imperial Fleet. Whereas the Imperial warship resembled a pointed dagger in shape, a Mon Calamari cruiser lacked hard angles and was covered with ovoid forms suggesting an organic sculpture. There were pods attached all around the ship, containing turbolasers, sensor arrays and viewing ports, the latter fulfilling the ships' original intended role as an exploration and observation vessel. Each cruiser was of a unique design. Despite their smooth lines, these vessels were heavily armed with dozens of turbolasers, SW-7 ion cannons, tractor beam projectors and shield generators.</p>

					<p>The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer was a model of Imperial-class Star Destroyer in the service of the Imperial Navy. A wedge-shaped capital ship, it bristled with weapons emplacements, assault troops, boarding craft, and TIE line starfighters. In the era of the Galactic Empire, its command bridge was staffed by the finest crewmen in the navy.At first, Star Destroyers were deployed to sectors and systems caught in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, where they would crush any signs of sedition. During the Galactic Civil War the Destroyer's role changed to hunting downhigh value Rebel targets and bases.</p>
