	<img src="assets/ships/X-wing.jpeg" width = "auto" height = "400">
	<p>X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive<br>
	S-foils that resembled the High Galactic script's character "X" in attack<br>
	formation. They were heavily armed with four laser cannons on the S-foils and<br>
	proton torpedo launchers in the fuselage. X-wings were designed for<br>
	dogfighting and long missions. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance<br>
	used X-wing models like the T-65B X-wing starfighter and T-65C-A2 X-wing in<br>
	many battles, deploying X-wings in engagements such as the Attack on<br>
	Lothal, the Battle of Yavin, the Battle of Endor, and the Battle of Jakku.</p>

	<img src="assets/ships/TIE-Fighter.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
	<p>The TIE/LN starfighter, or TIE/line starfighter, simply known as the TIE<br>
	Fighter or T/F, was the standard Imperial starfighter seen in massive<br>
	numbers throughout most of the Galactic Civil War and onward. Colloquially,<br>
	Rebel and New Republic pilots referred to the craft as "eyeballs."</p>

	<img src="assets/ships/mc80.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
	<p>The MC80 Star Cruisers, were capital ships used by the Rebel Alliance<br>
	during the Galactic Civil War. These immense vessels were a startling contrast<br>
	to the angular-shaped Imperial-class Star Destroyers, which were favored by<br>
	the Imperial Fleet. Whereas the Imperial warship resembled a pointed dagger<br>
	in shape, a Mon Calamari cruiser lacked hard angles and was covered with<br>
	ovoid forms suggesting an organic sculpture. There were pods attached all<br>
	around the ship, containing turbolasers, sensor arrays and viewing ports, the<br>
	latter fulfilling the ships' original intended role as an exploration and<br>
	observation vessel. Each cruiser was of a unique design. Despite their<br>
	smooth lines, these vessels were heavily armed with dozens of turbolasers,<br>
	SW-7 ion cannons, tractor beam projectors and shield generators.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-class_Star_Destroyer" target= "_blank">Imperial I Star Destroyer</a></h2>
	<img src="assets/ships/destroyer.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
	<p>The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer was a model of Imperial-class Star<br>
	Destroyer in the service of the Imperial Navy. A wedge-shaped capital ship, it<br>
	bristled with weapons emplacements, assault troops, boarding craft, and TIE<br>
	line starfighters. In the era of the Galactic Empire, its command bridge was<br>
	staffed by the finest crewmen in the navy.At first, Star Destroyers were<br>
	deployed to sectors and systems caught in the aftermath of the Clone Wars,<br>
	where they would crush any signs of sedition. During the Galactic Civil War the<br>
	Destroyer's role changed to hunting downhigh value Rebel targets and bases.</p>
