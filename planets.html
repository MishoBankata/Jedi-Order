					<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant" target= "_blank">Coruscant</a></h2>
					
					<p>Coruscant (pronounced /'kɔɹəsɑnt/), also known as Imperial Center during<br>
					the rule of the Galactic Empire, was an ecumenopolis—a city-covered planet,<br>
					collectively known as Imperial City— in the Coruscant system of the Core<br>
					Worlds. Though debated by historians, it was generally believed that Coruscant<br>
					was the original homeworld of humanity. Coruscant was at one point also<br>
					historically the home of the ancient Taung and Zhell. Noted for its<br>
					cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population<br>
					consisted of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and<br>
					alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several<br>
					major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-<br>
					planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture,<br>
					education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the location of<br>
					several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza, and the<br>
					Senate Building.</p>

					<p>Naboo was a bountiful planet in the Chommell sector of the Mid Rim, in the<br>
					Trailing Sectors and close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories. It was<br>
					home to the indigenous Gungan species and to a population of humans known<br>
					as the Naboo. Naboo was pushed to the forefront of galactic politics as the<br>
					birthplace of the Dark Lord of the Sith Sheev Palpatine, who served as its<br>
					representative in the Senate of the Galactic Republic.</p>

					<p>Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the<br>
					galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited<br>
					two scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water<br>
					to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead<br>
					drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little<br>
					surface vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider<br>
					species and of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.</p>

					<p>Kamino (pronounced /kə'minoʊ/) was an aquatic extragalactic planet located<br>
					in a remote star system in the Abrion sector beyond the Outer Rim just outside<br>
					the boundaries of the galaxy and straggled south of the Rishi Maze irregular<br>
					dwarf satellite galaxy. It was inhabited by the Kaminoans — a race of tall,<br>
					elegant beings with long necks who were regarded as a mysterious species<br>
					that tended to keep to themselves. They were also known for their cloning<br>
					technology, which was used to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic.</p>
