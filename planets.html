	<p>The Jedi High Council, simply known as the Jedi Council, was a body of<br>
	twelve Jedi Masters that governed the Jedi Order. Headquartered in the Jedi<br>
	Grand Temple on Coruscant, the High Council worked with the Galactic Senate<br>
	to maintain peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. In addition, the High<br>
	Council tracked the progress of the Jedi training of Padawans, deciding when<br>
	the time was right for an apprentice to undergo the Jedi Trials in order to<br>
	attain the rank of Jedi Knight, and from there, the rank of Master. The High<br>
	Council also enforced the Jedi Code and traditionally selected its own<br>
	members, including the Master of the Order who functioned as the body's<br>
	presiding officer.</p>

	<p>Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master who led the Jedi Order in the years leading<br>
	up to its destruction by the Sith and the transition of the Galactic Republic<br>
	into the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and<br>
	power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Jedi Order's<br>
	Grand Master. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the<br>
	Clone Wars, passing on the Jedi tradition to Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the<br>
	path to immortality.</p>
