		<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant" target= "_blank">Coruscant</a></h2>
		<img src="assets/planets/coruscant.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
		<p>Coruscant (pronounced /'kɔɹəsɑnt/), also known as Imperial Center during<br>
		the rule of the Galactic Empire, was an ecumenopolis—a city-covered planet,<br>
		collectively known as Imperial City— in the Coruscant system of the Core<br>
		Worlds. Though debated by historians, it was generally believed that Coruscant<br>
		was the original homeworld of humanity. Coruscant was at one point also<br>
		historically the home of the ancient Taung and Zhell. Noted for its<br>
		cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population<br>
		consisted of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and<br>
		alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several<br>
		major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-<br>
		planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture,<br>
		education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the location of<br>
		several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza, and the<br>
		Senate Building.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo" target= "_blank">Naboo</a></h2>
		<img src="assets/planets/naboo.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
		<p>Naboo was a bountiful planet in the Chommell sector of the Mid Rim, in the<br>
		Trailing Sectors and close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories. It was<br>
		home to the indigenous Gungan species and to a population of humans known<br>
		as the Naboo. Naboo was pushed to the forefront of galactic politics as the<br>
		birthplace of the Dark Lord of the Sith Sheev Palpatine, who served as its<br>
		representative in the Senate of the Galactic Republic.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine" target= "_blank">Tatooine</a></h2>
		<img src="assets/planets/tatooine.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
		<p>Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the<br>
		galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited<br>
		two scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water<br>
		to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead<br>
		drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little<br>
		surface vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider<br>
		species and of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.</p>
		
		<br><br>

		<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kamino" target= "_blank">Kamino</a></h2>
		<img src="assets/planets/kamino.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
		<p>Kamino (pronounced /kə'minoʊ/) was an aquatic extragalactic planet located<br>
		in a remote star system in the Abrion sector beyond the Outer Rim just outside<br>
		the boundaries of the galaxy and straggled south of the Rishi Maze irregular<br>
		dwarf satellite galaxy. It was inhabited by the Kaminoans — a race of tall,<br>
		elegant beings with long necks who were regarded as a mysterious species<br>
		that tended to keep to themselves. They were also known for their cloning<br>
		technology, which was used to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic.</p>
