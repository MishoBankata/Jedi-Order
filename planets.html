			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant" target= "_blank">Coruscant</a></h2>
			
			<p class="textp">Coruscant, also known as Imperial Center during the rule of the Galactic Empire, was an ecumenopolis—a city-covered planet— in the Coruscant system of the Core Worlds. Though debated by historians, it was generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity. Coruscant's population consisted of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology.</p>

			<p>Naboo was a bountiful planet in the Chommell sector of the Mid Rim, in the Trailing Sectors and close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories. It was home to the indigenous Gungan species and to a population of humans known as the Naboo. Naboo was pushed to the forefront of galactic politics as the birthplace of the Dark Lord of the Sith Sheev Palpatine, who served as its representative in the Senate of the Galactic Republic.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine" target= "_blank">Tatooine</a></h2>
			
			<p>Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited two scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little surface vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider species and of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kamino" target= "_blank">Kamino</a></h2>
			
			<p>Kamino (pronounced /kə'minoʊ/) was an aquatic extragalactic planet located in a remote star system in the Abrion sector beyond the Outer Rim just outside the boundaries of the galaxy and straggled south of the Rishi Maze irregular dwarf satellite galaxy. It was inhabited by the Kaminoans — a race of tall, elegant beings with long necks who were regarded as a mysterious species that tended to keep to themselves. They were also known for their cloning technology, which was used to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic.</p>
