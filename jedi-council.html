			<h1><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_High_Counci" target= "_blank">Jedi High Council</a></h1>
			<img src="assets/council/council.jpg" width = "600" height = "auto">
			<p>The Jedi High Council, simply known as the Jedi Council, was a body of<br>
			twelve Jedi Masters that governed the Jedi Order. Headquartered in the Jedi<br>
			Grand Temple on Coruscant, the High Council worked with the Galactic Senate<br>
			to maintain peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. In addition, the High<br>
			Council tracked the progress of the Jedi training of Padawans, deciding when<br>
			the time was right for an apprentice to undergo the Jedi Trials in order to<br>
			attain the rank of Jedi Knight, and from there, the rank of Master. The High<br>
			Council also enforced the Jedi Code and traditionally selected its own<br>
			members, including the Master of the Order who functioned as the body's<br>
			presiding officer.</p>
			
			<br><br>

			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda" target= "_blank">Yoda</a></h2>
			<img src="assets/council/Yoda.jpg" width = "400" height = "auto">
			<p>Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master who led the Jedi Order in the years leading<br>
			up to its destruction by the Sith and the transition of the Galactic Republic<br>
			into the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and<br>
			power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Jedi Order's<br>
			Grand Master. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the<br>
			Clone Wars, passing on the Jedi tradition to Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the<br>
			path to immortality.</p>

			<br><br>

			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu" target= "_blank">Mace Windu</a></h2>
			<img src="assets/council/Mace-Windu.jpeg" width = "400" height = "auto">
			<p>Mace Windu was a revered Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master and<br>
			member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Republic Era.<br>
			During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi<br>
			and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the<br>
			Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its<br>
			ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in<br>
			the corrupt, declining days of the Republic.</p>
			
			<br><br>
			
			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Plo_Koon" target= "_blank">Plo Koon</a></h2>
			<img src="assets/council/Plo-Koon.jpg" width = "400" height = "auto">
			<p>Plo Koon was a Force-sensitive Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a member<br>
			of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He<br>
			served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic<br>
			conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of<br>
			Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous<br>
			missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion. Koon wore<br>
			a breath mask to filter the air around him so that it matched his home planet of<br>
			Dorin, and wore goggles to prevent his eye fluids from evaporating.</p>
			
			<br><br>

			<h2><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi" target= "_blank">Ki-Adi-Mundi</a></h2>
			<img src="assets/council/Ki-Adi-Mundi.jpg" width = "400" height = "auto">
			<p>Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Force-sensitive Cerean male Jedi Master and<br>
			member of the Jedi High Council during the last decades of the<br>
			Galactic Republic. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars after the<br>
			First Battle of Geonosis, Mundi became a Jedi General of the Grand<br>
			Army of the Republic. Like his Jedi colleagues, he led the Republic<br>
			clone troopers against the Separatist Alliance forces in several<br>
			battles across the galaxy, including the second campaign on<br>
			Geonosis</p>
